# Configuring Exposure Notification Risk Scores for COVID-19


## Guidance from the Risk Score Symposium Invitational


# Introduction

Exposure notifications are phone-based alerts that people can receive to inform them that they’ve been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19. The Exposure Notification System (ENS) provided by Apple and Google has a configurable component, a risk score, which allows health authorities to specify which types or levels of exposures should trigger a notification.  

In a series of virtual meetings in November 2020, the Risk Score Symposium Invitational brought together specialists and experts from multiple disciplines who were actively involved in ENS implementation and/or research. The symposium’s purpose was to inform the decision-making process for health authorities who are using, or plan to use, ENS in their region.

Below, we provide risk score parameter guidance based on currently available evidence. These recommendations are intended to be shared and open sourced, so the larger community can contribute to and improve upon these recommendations, especially as more data become available.

This guidance should be viewed as a starting point; each public health authority will need to make their own decisions tailored to the communities they are serving.


# Structure of the risk score

The risk score estimates, in minutes, the degree of relevant exposure to someone with a COVID-19 diagnosis. It is calculated by multiplying two[^1] weighted terms together: (1) duration at Bluetooth attenuation and (2) infectiousness of the index patient based on days since symptom onset.  Further documentation on the structure of the risk score and how it is calculated (including a worked example) is available from [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/exposurenotification/enexposureconfiguration) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/meaningful-exposures) technical specification documents.

# Configuring Bluetooth attenuations 

Bluetooth attenuations offer a very noisy signal of proximity, impacted by the device hardware, phone cases, environmental surroundings (obstacles and reflections), phone antenna orientation, placement in pockets/bags, how the device is held, and more.  

Based on data from experiments evaluating several real-life scenarios in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Germany, the signal strength working group considered tradeoffs for capturing particular distance and duration scenarios.  The Signal Strength Working Group agreed on two consensus configuration options:



*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Narrower-net specification</span>: the intention is to **prioritize specificity**, favoring sending fewer notifications to capture some fraction of close contacts while limiting the number of further-distance exposures captured 
*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wider-net specification</span>: the intention is to **prioritize sensitivity**, favoring sending more notifications to capture most close-contact exposures and a non-negligible amount of further-distance exposures

# Configuring infectiousness 

Timing of exposure relative to symptom onset is known to impact risk of COVID-19 transmission[^2][^3].  

The recommendations below assume a known symptom onset date; no consensus was reached on how to treat cases with no symptom onset date.  For individuals who test positive without symptoms (or do not provide information on symptom onset), using the test date in place of symptom onset date is likely to overestimate transmission risk. Ignoring these individuals would likely underestimate transmission risk. More targeted research to address the risk posed by asymptomatic individuals is needed. 

Based on available data, the clinical/epidemiology working group agreed on two potential consensus configurations:



*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Narrower-net specification</span>: the intention is to **prioritize specificity**, favoring sending fewer notifications restricting to exposures during the period of peak infectiousness
*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wider-net specification</span>: the intention is to **prioritize sensitivity**, favoring sending more notifications and capturing exposures over a longer period of potential infectiousness

# Choosing notification thresholds

The weights for the configurations above assume health authorities will prefer to use a threshold of 15 minutes (for ease of communication and consistency in messaging).  While this parameter can also be adjusted, the group did not evaluate the impact of changing it.  

The symposium contributors considered messaging associated with notifications to be out of scope in composing this recommendation. Messaging should be crafted by the health authority to be situationally appropriate.  Health authorities may also consider using multiple thresholds to send more targeted text/instructions based on the risk of the encounter.


# Further information and resources

To discuss this document with the working group please join the Linux Foundation Public Health Slack channel at [slack.lfph.io](slack.lfph.io). In that community you will also be able to discuss exposure notification rollouts with other public health authorities who have launched their own solutions. 

The SwissCovid team has released data from their real-life Bluetooth measurements at: [https://github.com/DP-3T/bt-measurements.](https://github.com/DP-3T/bt-measurements)

The experiments evaluated several real-life scenarios and provide both ground truth distance/attenuation data along with raw dumps of GAEN messages that can be used for the analysis of different configurations.

Details about the GAEN API and protocol description are at: [https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/)

The DP3T white papers for the underlying exposure notification protocol are available at [https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/) 

The [COVID Tuner risk score configuration tool](https://risk-score-tuner.appspot.com/) is freely available to health authorities.  Please contact Google developer relations for login information[^5].
